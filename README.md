My first game project in Java.

My current work is in 'basics of the game' banch.
In the master banch there is source code of working prototype (later fully functional source code of my game).
Do not mind the executable jar file in master branch (beneath is how to compile and where to find it).

Instalation instruction:

- download file from master branch.
- unpack
- double click on it (or open terminal and run via java)
- if it is not working check in properties if file is executable

Or

- go to the JGame (where is gradlew file) 
- in shell run ./gradlew desktop:dist
- the result is in JGame -> desktop -> build -> libs -> (chose game version)
- run file: java -jar (file name)


Code instalation instruction:
- download
- unpack
- in your IDE import as a gradle project (use gradle version between 4.7 and 4.10.2).
