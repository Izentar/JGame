My first game project in Java.

By Mateusz Kordowski

index 293127

My current work will be in the upcoming branch "current work". For now it is in 'basic of the game'.
In the master branch will be only executable jar file.

Instalation instruction
- download file from master branch.
- unpack
- double click on it (or open terminal and run via java)
- if it is not working check in properties if file is executable
